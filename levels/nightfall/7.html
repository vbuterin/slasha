You have defeated Xandros and freed your city and queen from oppression. With Xandros's death, Queen Madrina seizes the crystal. No longer maintained by Xandros the hordes of demons dematerialize just as hundreds of them rush into their room to help their (no longer existent) master. However, the Crystal of Xubuntu is inherently evil and does not recognize good as a master. Years after peace is restored, Queen Madrina herself becomes possessed by its power... (Hey, I had to leave room for a sequel!)
