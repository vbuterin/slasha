The island of Lindra has, for over five decades, been a peaceful and prosperous place, with living conditions of farmers there approaching those of landlords in the neignboring countries inland. The island gained this peace by being well defended, but your people have forgotten the art of war. One day, two ships enter the city, looking for trade. Your people are somewhat suspicious of foreigners, but the people in the ships have much to offer, and they are allowed in. The next day, however, a full fleet of forty ships appears, coming in to attack. Your people, confused, rush to the catapults, but they have been sabotaged, along with three of the walled city's gates. The ships land and, within three hours, three quarters of the residents are dead or enslaved. You are leading one of the pockets of resistance, but it is clear that you cannot win. You must instead escape, first to the door on the left.
